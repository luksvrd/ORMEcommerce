## Description

A Node.js backend for an e-commerce site utilizing mysql2, sequalize, and express. The API can perform CRUD operations on the database. This project was a great way to learn how to use sequalize and how to create a backend for a website. It was also good to practice using Insomnia to test the API.

## Installation

The following necessary dependencies must be installed to run the application properly:

- This Generator assumes you have a 'complete dev environment' setup - a terminal, Node, & VS Code. To get started, Fork the repository and clone the new repo from your Github to your local computer. `cd` into the cloned repo and enter: `npm i`

- Various VS Code 'settings' and 'extensions.' Look in the bottom right when you open this up in VS Code to install them.
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. Just do `npm test` or `npm t`.

## Usage

Once you `cd` into the repo, `cd main` & run `npm i` to install all the things. You can then start the server and create the tables for the database by executing `node server.js`. In order to see the database, execute `node seeds/index.js`. Use an app like Insomnia Core to test your CRUD opperations on the database.
